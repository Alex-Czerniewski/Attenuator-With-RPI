Serial communication protocol analysis

The overall structure of the CNC attenuator ATT-6000 protocol adopts the command line mode, and the communication baud rate is 115200bps. 
The PC sends out the command, the machine parses and executes it, and then returns the result to the PC. 
The command is limited to lowercase letters a~z and the number 0 ~9, 
the end symbol of each command is a newline character (hexadecimal representation is "0x0a" or'/n')

Communication commands include three types of commands: w command

wv0 command: set the output attenuation

The format is: wv0xxxx + 0x0a, a total of 8 bytes;

Where "xxxx" is the attenuation value represented by 4 numbers, such as:

wv01150\n: indicates that the write attenuation is: 11.5DB (the maximum attenuation is: 0-3175, the step is 25)

Converted into hexadecimal: that is 0X77 0X76 0X30 0X31 0X31 0X35 0X30 0X0a

0X77 0X76 0X30 0X31 0X31 0X35 0X30 0X0a
w     v    0     1    1    5   0    \n
